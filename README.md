# Pharmaceuticals Finance Data Analysis - Week 4

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on forecasting sales across multiple stores in various cities six weeks in advance. The objective is to analyze customer purchasing behavior and evaluate the impact of factors such as promotions, store openings, and other key metrics on sales.

## Setup Environment
The initial step is to set up a Python development environment, integrate version control, and configure CI/CD workflows for continuous integration and deployment.

## Deliverables
- Python Environment Setup: A fully configured development environment with all necessary libraries and tools.
- GitHub Repository: Includes appropriate branches for collaboration and version control.
- CI/CD Workflows: Configuration files under .github/workflows/ for continuous integration and deployment.

 ## Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior
 ## Objective
    - Analyze how key factors, such as promotions, new store openings, and other operational measures, influence customer purchasing behavior.
## Tasks
- Set up a GitHub repository with a dedicated task-1 branch.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Jupyter Notebook (exploratory_analysis.ipynb).
- Implement logging with Python's logging library to ensure traceability and reproducibility of the analysis steps.
- Commit progress at least three times daily, with descriptive and clear commit messages.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following Python libraries:

- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- seaborn: Data visualization.
- scikit-learn: Machine learning tools.
- matplotlib: Plotting and visualization.
- logging: Tracking and documenting process flows.
